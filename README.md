## 📁 Dataset Used

- 📦 **Name**: Mall Customer Segmentation Data  
- 🌐 **Source**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python/data)  
- 🗃 **Raw File**: `Mall_Customers.csv`  
- 🧼 **Cleaned File**: `Mall_Customers_Cleaned.csv`

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment

- 🐍 Python 3 (Jupyter Notebook)
- 📚 Pandas
- 📓 Notebook: `EL_Task1.ipynb`

## ✅ Cleaning Steps Performed

| Step |                       Action                              |
|------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1️⃣ | Loaded the raw dataset using Pandas |
| 2️⃣ | Checked and confirmed there were no missing values |
| 3️⃣ | Removed duplicate rows |
| 4️⃣ | Renamed columns to lowercase with underscores |
| 5️⃣ | Standardized text in `gender` column (e.g., "Male" → "male") |
| 6️⃣ | Converted `customerid` column to integer |
| 7️⃣ | Dropped unnecessary columns like `unnamed:_0` (if present) |
| 8️⃣ | Sorted dataset by `annual_income_(k$)` (optional) |
| 9️⃣ | Created `age_group` column using bins (optional) |
| 🔟 | Saved the cleaned dataset to `Mall_Customers_Cleaned.csv` |
